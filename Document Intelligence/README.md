Azure AI Document Intelligence (previously known as Form Recognizer) is a cloud service that uses machine learning to analyze text and structured data from your documents. It includes the following main features:

- Layout - Extract content and structure (ex. words, selection marks, tables) from documents.
- Document - Analyze key-value pairs in addition to general layout from documents.
- Read - Read page information from documents.
- Prebuilt - Extract common field values from select document types (ex. receipts, invoices, business cards, ID documents, U.S. W-2 tax documents, among others) using prebuilt models.
- Custom - Build custom models from your own data to extract tailored field values in addition to general layout from documents.
- Classifiers - Build custom classification models that combine layout and language features to accurately detect and identify documents you process within your application.
- Add-on capabilities - Extract barcodes/QR codes, formulas, font/style, etc. or enable high resolution mode for large documents with optional parameters.
